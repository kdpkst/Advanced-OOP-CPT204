# Data Structure

This project contains my implementations of various data structures in Java, completed during weekly lab sessions at XJTLU.

## Introduction

The professors provided the initial skeleton code for each data structure implementation. My work focused on completing or adding functionality to these provided skeletons to achieve the desired data structure behavior.  


## How to Use

The directory "library" contains all the dependancies needed.  
Go to directory "src", then you can navigate to each directory to explore the implementation and find the provided skeleton code as well as my completed implementation.
